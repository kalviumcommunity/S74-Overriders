##  Technical Insight

###  How does choosing between static, dynamic, and hybrid rendering affect performance, scalability, and data freshness in a Next.js application?

Next.js provides **three rendering strategies**, each with trade-offs:

####  Static Rendering (SSG – Static Site Generation)

* Pages are generated at build time
* Extremely fast load times (served via CDN)
* Highly scalable with minimal server cost
* Data does **not update** unless the site is rebuilt

**Best for:**

* Landing pages
* About pages
* Static content like platform vision

---

####  Dynamic Rendering (SSR – Server-Side Rendering)

* Pages are generated on every request
* Always shows the **latest data**
* Slower than static pages
* Higher server load, less scalable

**Best for:**

* User dashboards
* Order history
* Personalized content

---

####  Hybrid Rendering (SSG + SSR + ISR)

* Combines static and dynamic approaches
* Uses **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** to update data periodically
* Balances performance and freshness
* More flexible and scalable

**Best for:**

* Artwork listings
* Artist profile pages
* Marketplaces like CraftsfromRoots

---

###  Why Hybrid Rendering is Ideal for CraftsfromRoots

* Static pages ensure fast global access
* Dynamic rendering keeps user-specific data fresh
* ISR allows artwork updates without rebuilding the entire site
* Results in **better performance, scalability, and real-time accuracy**

---

## Redis Caching Integration

Redis is used as a caching layer to improve API performance.

### Cached Endpoint
- GET /api/users

### Strategy
- Cache-aside pattern
- Redis checked before database
- TTL set to 60 seconds

### Cache Invalidation
- Cache key `users:list` is deleted on POST
- Ensures data freshness

### Performance Results
- Cold request (DB): ~120ms
- Warm request (Redis): ~10ms

### Reflection
A stale cache is worse than no cache because it can mislead users. By using TTLs and explicit invalidation on write operations, the application maintains both performance and data accuracy.


### Why is environment segregation (development, staging, production) essential in modern deployments, and how does secure secret management improve the safety and reliability of your CI/CD pipelines?

Modern applications like CraftsfromRoots, deployed using Docker, cloud platforms (AWS/Azure), and GitHub Actions, require strict separation of environments and secure handling of secrets to remain safe, stable, and scalable.

**Environment Segregation**
Environment segregation means maintaining separate development, staging, and production environments, each with its own configuration, database, and resources.
Development Environment
Used by developers for daily coding and testing
Allows experimentation and debugging
Failures here do not impact users
Staging Environment
Mirrors production as closely as possible
Used for final testing, QA, and client/demo validation
Catches bugs before real users are affected
Production Environment
Live system used by real users
Must be stable, secure, and monitored
Changes are deployed only after validation
 Why It Is Essential
Prevents unfinished or broken features from reaching users
Protects production data from accidental corruption
Enables safe testing of new releases
Improves reliability and confidence in deployments

**Secure Secret Management in CI/CD Pipelines**

Secrets include:
Database credentials
API keys
JWT secrets
Redis passwords
Cloud access tokens
Risks Without Secure Management
Secrets hardcoded in repositories can be leaked
Compromised credentials can expose databases and servers
Builds may fail or behave unpredictably across environments
Secure Practices Used
Secrets stored in GitHub Actions Secrets or cloud secret managers
Different secrets for dev, staging, and production
Environment variables injected at runtime
Secrets never committed to version control

**Benefits to CI/CD Pipelines**

Prevents unauthorized access even if code is exposed
Ensures consistent and reproducible builds
Allows safe automation of deployments
Enables quick secret rotation without code changes

## Database Schema Design

### Core Entities

* **User**: Registered user of the application.
* **Project**: Created and owned by a user.
* **Task**: Individual task under a project.

### Prisma Schema

```prisma
model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String
  projects  Project[]
}

model Project {
  id      Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title   String
  userId  Int
  user    User    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  tasks   Task[]

  @@index([userId])
}

model Task {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  completed Boolean @default(false)
  projectId Int
  project   Project @relation(fields: [projectId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([projectId])
}
```

### Relationships & Constraints

* One User → Many Projects
* One Project → Many Tasks
* Foreign keys enforce referential integrity
* `ON DELETE CASCADE` prevents orphan records
* Unique constraint on user email
* Indexed foreign keys improve query performance

### Normalization

The schema follows **3NF**, avoiding redundancy and ensuring all non-key attributes depend only on their primary keys.

### Migrations

Tables were created using Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema
```

Seed data was added to validate relationships.

## Authorization Middleware

All protected API routes are secured using a centralized middleware.

### Flow
Client → Middleware → JWT Validation → Role Check → API Route

### Role Rules
- `/api/users` → Any authenticated user
- `/api/admin` → Admin only

### Security Principles
- JWT verified on every request
- Least privilege enforced
- Unauthorized access returns 401/403
# 📄 README – Features & Functionality Added

This project demonstrates routing features implemented using the **Next.js 13+ App Router**, focusing on scalability, authentication, and user experience.

---

## ✅ Features Added

### 🧭 File-Based Routing
- Routing implemented using the `app/` directory
- Each folder represents a route
- `page.tsx` files define route entry points

---

### 🌐 Public Routes
The following routes are accessible without authentication:
- `/` – Home page
- `/login` – Login page

---

### 🔒 Protected Routes
The following routes require authentication:
- `/dashboard`
- `/users`
- `/users/[id]`

Access is restricted using middleware-based authentication.

---

### 🔐 Middleware Authentication
- Added `middleware.ts` to protect private routes
- JWT token is read from cookies
- Unauthorized users are redirected to `/login`
- Valid tokens allow access to protected pages

---

### 🔄 Dynamic Routing
- Implemented dynamic routing using `[id]` folder syntax
- `/users/[id]` renders user-specific content dynamically
- Single template supports multiple user profiles

**Example URLs:**
- `/users/1`
- `/users/2`

---

### 🧱 Global Layout & Navigation
- Added `layout.tsx` for shared UI
- Persistent navigation bar across pages
- Improves consistency and usability

---

### 🧭 Breadcrumb Navigation
- Added breadcrumbs on dynamic user pages
- Helps users understand page hierarchy
- Enhances navigation and SEO

**Example:**
